      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-quiet-beginning-and-the-first-ripples&#34;&gt;The Quiet Beginning and the First Ripples&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010, a Mozilla researcher named Graydon Hoare began working on a personal project born from frustration—a stuck elevator had triggered a software failure that could have been prevented with better memory management. This moment of annoyance would eventually give birth to Rust, a language that would fundamentally challenge how we think about systems programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For its first few years, Rust remained largely within Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s walls, quietly evolving through rapid iterations. The language reached its 1.0 stable release in May 2015, marking the beginning of its public journey. But it wasn&amp;rsquo;t until 2017-2018 that the first significant impacts began to show. &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.rust-lang.org/2017/11/14/Fearless-Concurrency-In-Firefox-Quantum/&#34;&gt;Firefox&amp;rsquo;s Quantum release in 2017, which incorporated Rust components for CSS parsing and rendering&lt;/a&gt;, demonstrated that Rust could deliver on its promises at scale—offering both memory safety and performance that matched or exceeded C++.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
