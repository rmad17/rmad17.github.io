### Your app is built and you need to deploy it. What Next? Read On...

Before we deploy applications we need to follow a set of process to ensure we are prepared with enough information to manage any issue which may or may not be critical.
Over the years I have experienced these scenarios and I have created a set of my personal checklists which allow me to quickly check 
that my application meets all the requirements for recovering from potential pitfalls. 

Broadly these are the following points we will be covering:
1. Error Tracking.
2. Secrets Management.
3. Environment Variables.
4. Dockerfile(s).
5. Log Setup.
6. Static Storage.
7. Database Setup.
8. Application Infrastruture.
