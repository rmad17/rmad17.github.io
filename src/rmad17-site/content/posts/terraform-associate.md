I recently passed my Terraform Associate certification exam and decided to write about the preparation, why and how I prepared for it.

## Why Hashicorp Certified Terraform Associate?

Lets address the `elephant in the post`. Why `Hashicorp Terraform Associate` certification ? 
I have worked with Terraform OSS a couple of years ago quite extensively. Recently, I was exploring it again while looking to hire folks with Terraform skills. Its during that time
I came across certifications offerred by Terraform. In the `Infrastructure as Code (IAC)` world Terraform is one of the most popular names and being certified in it adds credibility as well as is very good learning experience.

## How to go about preparation?
Just like preparing for other certifications I usually look into what are the popular study materials like Udemy courses, blogs and practice papers. Practice papers are very 
important in my preparation process as an easy way to identify topics that I need to put more efforts. There are some video courses avaiable of which the most useful one seems is the one by FreeCodeCamp. Personally, I did not go through the video and I decided to study from the documentation of Terraform which has a very well organized documentation.
