## The Backstory

I have been a vim user since a decade back and switched to using neovim more than five years ago. Anyone familiar with the vim/neovim ecosystem would know how much it has evolved in the last few years. I had started with using `Vundle` for managing my plugins, moving to `Plug` at a later point. All this while my configuration was a simple vim script (`init.vim`) where my configurations were neatly organized in less than ~200 lines. For sometime I have been reading about the craze --  that is neovim lua configurations and after contemplating several times if the result will be worth the effort, finally decided to join in. What followed was a weeks of diving deep into lua script and relearning a lot of processes, I finally got my config to be close to how I wanted it to be and this is a story of that journey.
